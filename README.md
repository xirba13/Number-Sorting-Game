# Number-Sorting-Game
A game that consists in oredering numbers generated randomly. I was helped by ChatGPT. You need to have Java installed to run it.


 This is a logic and  (no) skill-based game that involves sorting numbers in ascending order. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the game:

In the game interface, you will see a set of empty text fields. The number of text fields depends on the game mode you've selected (it can be 2, 5, 10, 20 or custom fields).

To start, you need to press the "Generate Number" button. When you do that, a random number (between 1 and 1000) will be generated at the top of the interface in a large label.

Your goal is to enter that random number into the text fields in ascending order. You should start with the empty text field in the top-left corner and continue filling the fields from left to right and from top to bottom.

To enter the number into a text field, click on it. The generated number will be automatically copied into the text field you clicked. You need to enter the numbers in the correct order to win the game.

If at any point you enter a number into the wrong text field, the game will display "YOU LOSE" on the large label, and the game will end. You will need to click the "Restart Game" button to start over.

If you successfully fill all the text fields in ascending order, the game will display "YOU WIN" on the large label, and you will have won the game. In this case, the game will also record your win and count the played game.

The game keeps track of your wins and games played based on the game mode you selected. It also calculates and displays your "Win Rate," which is the percentage of games won in relation to games played (except in custom mode).

You can return to the main menu at any time by clicking the "Back to Menu" button.

The objective of the game is to test your ability to sort numbers in ascending order and see how many games you can win based on the selected game mode. The more text fields you have, the more challenging the game becomes. Enjoy playing!

Note: th exe file does not work correctly if the scale in Windows Settings is different from 100%.
